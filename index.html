            Create a single really tall section that will use the Bootstrap Grid and take up
            the entire width of the browser window (minus some margins, of course) for all
            views: desktop, tablet, and mobile. To make the section really tall, you can
            either fill it out with a LOT of text or simply set its height to something like
            1000px. It needs to be tall enough to cause scrolling down to be required to
            view the bottom of the section. Make sure its background color is set to
            distinguish it from the rest of the content. (Hint: don't forget to have an
            element with a class='container' or class='container-fluid' wrapping your
            grid. Remember that to have the grid do something "always", i.e., no matter
            what browser window size, use the col-xs-... classes. In this case, since we
            want the section to take up the entire row, use col-xs-12.).
